- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use double quotes for variables: `"$variable"`

### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Function to check system requirements
check_requirements() {
    local min_disk_space="2000000"  # 2GB in KB
    
    if [[ $(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}') -lt $min_disk_space ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå Insufficient disk space"
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ System requirements met"
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
