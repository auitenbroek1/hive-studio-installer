## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Alias Assignments **REMOVED**
```bash
# REMOVED from install.sh:
alias hivestudio='claude'  # Line 299 - DELETED
alias hivestart='claude'   # Line 300 - DELETED
# Shell config installation also REMOVED (lines 1465-1471)
```

### Remaining Claude Aliases (Still Active)
```bash
alias ai='claude'
alias hs='claude' 
alias hive='claude'
```

### Text Instructions **PRESERVED**
- Step 4: "After Claude Code is running, type command **hivestudio** to launch Hive Studio"
- Important section: Full **hivestudio** launch sequence documentation
- Completion summary: References to **hivestudio** and **hivestart** shortcuts

## 📋 Next Steps Required

### **ONLY REMAINING TASK: Command Assignment Decision**
**Question**: What should `hivestudio` and `hivestart` commands actually do?

**Current State**: 
- ❌ No longer aliased to `claude` command
- ✅ All instructional text refers to these commands
- ⚠️ Commands will show "command not found" if user follows instructions

**Options for Implementation**:
1. **Separate Scripts**: Create standalone `hivestudio` and `hivestart` executables
2. **Enhanced Aliases**: Assign to complex command sequences  
3. **Function Definitions**: Create shell functions with specific behaviors
4. **Launch Scripts**: Create dedicated launcher scripts in PATH

## 🚀 Installation Flow Summary

1. **Welcome Wizard** → Professional golden box with 5-minute promise
2. **Shell Detection** → Intelligent bash/zsh handling with user choice
3. **Progressive Installation** → Real-time monitoring without error spam
4. **Success Celebration** → Clean completion with terminal restart guidance
5. **Ready State** → Claude Code installed, aliases configured, user guided
