# Claude Code Terminal Compatibility Fix for MacBook Pro

## Problem Analysis

The error "Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin" occurs when Claude Code's Ink-based terminal UI cannot access proper TTY (terminal) capabilities. This is a **known environment issue**, not a Claude Code bug.

## Root Cause Identification

Based on our analysis, this error happens when:

1. **Terminal Environment**: Running in non-interactive environments
2. **TTY Support**: Terminal doesn't provide raw mode capabilities  
3. **Process Context**: stdin is not connected to a proper TTY
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing proper terminal configuration

## Current Environment Status
- **Node.js**: v22.17.0 ✅ (Compatible)
- **npm**: 11.4.2 ✅ (Latest)
- **Claude Code**: v1.0.100 ✅ (Installed)
- **Terminal**: WarpTerminal (not standard Apple Terminal)
- **Shell**: zsh ✅
- **Disk Space**: 69GB available ✅ (Sufficient)

## **Key Finding: Terminal Type Issue**

The system shows `TERM_PROGRAM: WarpTerminal` instead of Apple's default Terminal. Warp Terminal may have stdin/TTY handling differences that cause this error.

## Immediate Solutions for Lynsey

### **Solution 1: Use Apple Terminal (Recommended)**
1. Open **Spotlight** (Cmd + Space)
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. Run: `claude`
4. This should work without the raw mode error

### **Solution 2: Environment Variable Fix**
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
export FORCE_COLOR=0
export NODE_NO_READLINE=1  
claude
```

### **Solution 3: Non-Interactive Mode**
If available, try:
```bash
claude --help
claude --version
```

### **Solution 4: Terminal Reset**
```bash
reset
claude
```

## Technical Solutions

### **For Advanced Users**

#### Check TTY Support
```bash
# Check if running in proper TTY
tty
echo $TERM

# Test stdin support  
node -e "console.log('TTY:', process.stdin.isTTY)"
```

#### Alternative Terminal Apps
Try these MacOS terminal alternatives:
- **iTerm2**: Generally has better TTY support
- **Apple Terminal**: Default macOS terminal (most compatible)
- **Hyper**: Modern electron-based terminal

#### Environment Configuration
Add to `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
export NODE_NO_READLINE=1
```

## Common Workarounds by Environment

| Environment | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Warp Terminal | Switch to Apple Terminal |
| SSH Connection | Use local terminal instead |
| tmux/screen | Exit multiplexer, run directly |
| CI/CD | Use non-interactive flags |
| VS Code Terminal | Use external terminal |

## Disk Space Consideration

The warning about needing 20.48 GB vs 12.8 GB available might also contribute to issues:
- **Current**: 69GB available ✅ (This is actually sufficient)
- **The installer warning may be incorrect or outdated**

## Prevention Tips

1. **Use Apple Terminal** for Claude Code
2. **Avoid terminal multiplexers** (tmux, screen) when running Claude Code  
3. **Check TTY status** before running: `tty`
4. **Update terminal apps** regularly
5. **Use proper shell configuration**

## Verification Steps

After applying fixes, test:
```bash
# Basic functionality
claude --version

# Interactive mode  
claude

# Help system
claude --help
```

## When to Contact Support

Contact Claude Code support if:
- Error persists in Apple Terminal
- All workarounds fail
- Other CLI tools also show TTY errors
- System-wide terminal issues

## Summary

This is a **terminal compatibility issue**, not a Claude Code installation problem. The primary solution is switching from Warp Terminal to Apple Terminal for Claude Code usage. The installation was successful - it's just a runtime environment issue.
